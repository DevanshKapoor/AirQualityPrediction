# Air Quality Classifier

Welcome to the **Air Quality Classifier** project! This repository showcases a PyTorch-based neural network designed to classify air quality using **[Air Quality and Pollution Assessment dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mujtabamatin/air-quality-and-pollution-assessment)**. 🌍✨

---

## 📜 About the Project
This project aims to predict air quality levels (Good, Moderate, Poor, Hazardous) based on features like pollution metrics, weather conditions, and more. It's a great way to dive into **multi-class classification** in PyTorch while exploring an engaging dataset. 🌱
